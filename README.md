Sure, here are the steps to get your session cookie from Advent of Code:

Log in to Advent of Code and access any puzzle input page1.
Right-click the page and click "Inspect".
Navigate to the “Network” tab.
Click on any request, and go to the “Headers” tab.
Search through the “Request Headers” for a header named "cookie".
You should find one value that starts with session=, followed by a long string of hexadecimal characters.
Please note that the session cookies from the Advent of Code website are valid for about a month, so you only have to get your cookie once per event. The session cookie is a small piece of data used to authenticate yourself to the Advent of Code web servers2.
